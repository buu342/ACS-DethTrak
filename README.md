A death tracker for Zandronum's LMS gamemode. When the match ends, it displays a list of who died and in what order in the game's console. 
This is meant for LMS games where players have more than one life, but will work fine with those as well if you want a quick to read list of deaths.<br/><br/>

This WAD requested by the MDF community, for their LMS competitions.<br/><br/>

### How to use
  **1)** Include this WAD in your server's wad list.<br/>
  **2)** At the end of every LMS round, check the console to see the death list.<br/><br/>

### Changelog
**Version 1.1**
* Added support for draw matches (No man standing)
* Added support for timeout matches (multiple men standing)<br/><br/>

**Version 1.0**
* Initial release
